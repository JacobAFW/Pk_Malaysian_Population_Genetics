# Pk_Malaysian_Population_Genetics

This repo contains supplementary data for the manuscript "Evolving Plasmodium knowlesi subpopulations in Malaysia are linked to geographically dispersed genetic exchange events that overlap host-related genes, and exhibit evidence of both co- and superinfections", currently under revision at Molecular Ecology. 

The repo contains:
    - A markdown with the full workflow, including extensive annotation.
    - Scripts for the pipeline (fastq > filtered VCF). 
    - A Snakemake version of the pipeline (fastq > unfiltered VCF) can be found [here](https://github.com/JacobAFW/Variant_Calling_Pipeline).
    - Scripts for all statistical analyses. 

Feel free to contact me with questions.
Please acknowledge this repo (or for the Snakemake pipeline) if you used.
