# Pk_Malaysian_Population_Genetics

This repo contains supplementary data for the manuscript "Genomic epidemiology of Plasmodium knowlesi reveals putative genetic drivers of adpatation in Malaysia", currently under revision at Molecular Ecology.

The repo contains:
- A markdown with the full bioinformatics pipeline/workflow, including extensive annotation.
- Scripts for the individual steps of pipeline (fastq > filtered VCF). 
- An improved Snakemake version of the pipeline (fastq > unfiltered VCF) can be found [here](https://github.com/JacobAFW/Variant_Calling_Pipeline).
- A markdown with the full analysis workflow (including steps that didn't make into the final paper).
- Scripts for all statistical analyses. 

Feel free to contact me with questions.
Please acknowledge this repo (or for the Snakemake pipeline) if used.
